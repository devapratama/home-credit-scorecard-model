# Home Credit Scorecard Model

## About Company:
PT Home Credit Indonesia or better known as Home Credit is a multinational multi-purpose finance company. The company builds in-store financing services (on-the-spot cashless financing) for consumers who want to purchase products such as household appliances, electronic devices, mobile phones, and furniture. It also builds technology-based financing services. Founded in 2013 in Jakarta, Home Credit currently has more than 19,000 distribution points across 144 cities in Indonesia. As of March 2019, the company has served 3.4 million customers online and offline.

## Problem:
To enhance its credit scoring predictions, Home Credit employs various statistical and machine learning methods. The current challenge is to optimize the use of available data, ensuring that creditworthy customers are not unfairly denied loans, and that loan terms, including principal, maturity, and repayment schedules, are tailored to motivate customers to successfully meet their repayment obligations.

## Goal:
To enhance the financial inclusion of creditworthy clients by accurately identifying and providing them with appropriate credit facilities.

## Objective:
To refine the credit evaluation process to:
- Increase the number of loan approvals for clients who will successfully repay.
- Decrease the number of defaults by accurately predicting repayment difficulties.
- Balance the portfolio to maintain a healthy ratio of high-risk to low-risk loans.
- Retain customer trust and satisfaction by reducing wrongful loan rejections.

## Business Metric:
- Loan Approval Success Rate (LASR): This metric represents the proportion of approved loans that result in successful repayment without significant delinquencies. It is a direct reflection of the efficacy of the credit scoring model in real-world scenarios.
- The LASR can be calculated using the formula: LASR = Number of loans repaid on time / Total number of loans approved
- The LASR serves several purposes:
  - It aligns with the goal of increasing financial inclusion by measuring the success rate of approved loans.
  - It helps monitor the risk by reflecting the proportion of loans that do not go into default.
  - It supports customer satisfaction metrics, as a high LASR suggests that loans are being approved for clients who are indeed capable of repayment.
